      # Pushing to Remote

      So far, your commits only exist on your **local machine**.
      To share them and create a pull request, you need to push
      them to a **remote repository** on GitHub.

      - **Local** → Your computer
      - **Remote** → GitHub's servers (usually called "origin")

      **Press Enter to continue...**

  - step_id: "setup"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Let's set up our branch with a commit.

      **Type:** `git checkout -b add-login`
    expected_commands:
      - "git checkout -b add-login"
    success_message: "Branch created!"
    setup_changes:
      - "login.html"

  - step_id: "stage_commit"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Stage and commit your changes in one command using `-a`.

      (We have login.html with changes ready.)

      **Type:** `git add login.html`
    expected_commands:
      - "git add login.html"
      - "git add ."
    success_message: "Files staged!"

  - step_id: "commit"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Now commit the changes.

      **Type:** `git commit -m "Add login form"`
    expected_commands:
      - "git commit -m \"Add login form\""
      - "git commit -m 'Add login form'"
    success_message: "Committed!"

  - step_id: "check_remote"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Let's see what remotes are configured.

      **Type:** `git remote -v`
    expected_commands:
      - "git remote -v"
      - "git remote"
    success_message: |
      "origin" points to your GitHub repository. This is where
      we'll push our branch.
    failure_hints:
      - "Type: git remote -v"

      # Pushing Your Branch

      When you push, you're uploading your local commits to GitHub.

      The first time you push a new branch, use the `-u` flag:
      ```
      git push -u origin <branch-name>
      ```

      The `-u` flag sets up **tracking**, so future pushes are simpler.
      After that, you can just use `git push`.

      **Press Enter to continue...**

  - step_id: "push"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Push your branch to GitHub with upstream tracking.

      **Type:** `git push -u origin add-login`
    expected_commands:
      - "git push -u origin add-login"
      - "git push --set-upstream origin add-login"
    success_message: |
      Excellent! Your branch is now on GitHub! Notice the message
      suggesting you create a pull request.
    failure_hints:
      - "Use: git push -u origin <branch-name>"
      - "The branch name is 'add-login'"

  - step_id: "status_after"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Check the status to see the tracking relationship.

      **Type:** `git status`
    expected_commands:
      - "git status"
    success_message: |
      Now it shows your branch is tracking `origin/add-login`.
      You're ready to create a pull request!
    failure_hints:
      - "Type: git status"

      # Lesson Complete!

      You've learned how to push to GitHub:

      - **`git remote -v`** - View configured remotes
      - **`git push -u origin <branch>`** - Push with tracking
      - After the first push, just use **`git push`**

      **Key Point:** Always push your branch before creating a PR.
      The `-u` flag makes future pushes easier!
