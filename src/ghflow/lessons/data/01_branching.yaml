      # Welcome to GitHub Flow!

      In GitHub flow, we never commit directly to the **main** branch.
      Instead, we create a separate **feature branch** for each piece of work.

      This keeps the main branch clean and stable, while allowing us to
      experiment and collaborate safely on new features.

  - step_id: "view_branches"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Let's start by seeing what branches exist in your repository.

      **Type:** `git branch`
    expected_commands:
      - "git branch"
    success_message: |
      You can see we currently only have the **main** branch.
      The asterisk (*) shows which branch you're on.
    failure_hints:
      - "The command to list branches is 'git branch'"
      - "Just type: git branch"

      # Creating a Feature Branch

      Now we'll create a new branch for our feature. Good branch names are:
      - **Descriptive**: `add-login-form`, `fix-navbar-bug`
      - **Lowercase with hyphens**: `my-feature-name`
      - **Short but meaningful**: not just `feature1` or `test`

      We'll create a branch called **add-login** using `git checkout -b`.

      **Press Enter to continue...**

  - step_id: "create_branch"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Create and switch to a new branch called **add-login**.

      The `-b` flag tells git to **create** the branch and switch to it.

      **Type:** `git checkout -b add-login`
    expected_commands:
      - "git checkout -b add-login"
      - "git switch -c add-login"
    success_message: |
      Excellent! You've created a new branch and switched to it.
      Now any commits you make will be on this branch, not main.
    failure_hints:
      - "Use: git checkout -b <branch-name>"
      - "The branch name should be 'add-login'"
      - "Try: git checkout -b add-login"

  - step_id: "verify_branch"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Let's verify we're on the new branch.

      **Type:** `git branch`
    expected_commands:
      - "git branch"
    success_message: |
      Notice the asterisk (*) is now next to **add-login** - that's your current branch!
      You also still have **main**, but you're no longer on it.
    failure_hints:
      - "Type: git branch"

  - step_id: "switch_to_main"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      You can switch back to main at any time using `git checkout`.

      **Type:** `git checkout main`
    expected_commands:
      - "git checkout main"
      - "git switch main"
    success_message: |
      You're back on main! Switching branches is instant in Git.
    failure_hints:
      - "Use: git checkout main"

  - step_id: "switch_back"
    step_type: "command"
    instruction: |
      Now switch back to your feature branch to continue working.

      **Type:** `git checkout add-login`
    expected_commands:
      - "git checkout add-login"
      - "git switch add-login"
    success_message: |
      Perfect! You're back on your feature branch and ready to work.
    failure_hints:
      - "Use: git checkout add-login"

      # Lesson Complete!

      You've learned the first step of GitHub flow:

      - **`git branch`** - View all branches
      - **`git checkout -b <name>`** - Create and switch to a new branch
      - **`git checkout <name>`** - Switch to an existing branch

      **Key Point:** Always create a new branch before starting work.
      This keeps main clean and makes collaboration easier!
